To run the R code, name the abundance (kallisto output) and annotation (InterProScan output) input files in a similar format as well as the species list CSV file. Number the abundance and annotation files according to species. The species list CSV file was made in Microsoft Excel by typing each species name in order. Each species name should be typed on a separate row of the first column. Export the file as a CSV. In R, set the working directory to the same location as the input files. Run the code line by line.
